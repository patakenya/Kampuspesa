        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I earn money with CampusEarn?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          You can earn through two main ways: <strong>Referrals</strong> (earn 20%–45% commission on membership fees paid by your referrals) and <strong>Article Writing</strong> (Silver and Gold members earn KSh 300–500 per approved article). Payments are made via M-PESA.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I upgrade my tier later?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Yes! You can upgrade your tier from your dashboard at any time. Pay the difference for the new tier (e.g., KSh 250 to upgrade from Bronze to Silver) to unlock higher commissions and article writing opportunities.
